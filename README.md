# CODSOFT-TASK
This repository contains the collection of tasks I completed during my Python Programming Internship at CodSoft (June‚ÄìJuly 2025). Each task is designed to strengthen core Python concepts through hands-on project development. From building interactive command-line tools to creating useful everyday applications, this internship provided me with a valuable opportunity to apply my coding skills in practical scenarios.
 I had the opportunity to work on a series of real-world Python tasks that tested both my logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Each project reflects a key concept of Python programming ‚Äî from building basic utilities to creating interactive command-line applications. These tasks not only helped me strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals like functions, conditionals, loops, and data structures, but also introduced me to the importance of writing efficient, user-friendly, and well-documented code.

üîç What You'll Find Inside:

A **To-Do List Application** to manage daily tasks through simple CLI operations

A **Simple Calculator** to perform basic arithmetic calculations

A **Password Generator** to create strong, random passwords with customizable options

A **Contact Book** Application to store, update, search, and manage contact details

Each task is self-contained, well-documented, and easy to run ‚Äî making this repository a great reference point for beginners and fellow Python learners.

This internship has been a meaningful step in my journey as a developer, and I'm incredibly thankful to CodSoft for offering such a rewarding experience!
